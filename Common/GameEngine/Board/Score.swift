/// Scoring rules for Tetris. Which rules are applied (see `ScoringMasks`) detemines the score. Certain actions increase
/// the score more than other actions.
///
/// - Each block in a frozen piece generates a certain score - more blocks the greater the score.
/// - Increasing the number of unreachable gaps will decrease the score. Descreasing the number of unreachable gaps
///   will increase the score.
/// - The overall map condition will affect the score, with columns with large top/bottom deltas decreasing the score.
/// - Clearing rows will increase the score, with rows higher up in the bucket having a larger positive score adjustment.
/// - Clearing rows of homogeneous piece blocks will significantly increase the score.
///
/// Set `Annotated` to true to see (in the debug console) how scores are generated.
